## One more thing—Mobile as first class citizen

We can treat mobile as first class citizen. It provides more capatability than desktop.

In mobile, you can get current position by **GPS** sensor. You can get device rotation and motion via **acceleromemter** and **gyroscope**. You can accept camera photo upload via **file input**. Your reader can pin your web to their **home screen**. 

In near future, you mobile web can also access the **bluetooth**, **camera** raw data, and **push notification**.

Imagine a web page and web utility that makes use of these capatability, which we never imagine them in desktop web. The mobile web is the first class client. That’s the meaning of _Mobile First_.
