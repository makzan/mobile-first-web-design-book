## Page transition

By default, all page transitions are fading effect. We can control individual link transition by adding `data-transition` attribute to the a href. For example, the following link would display the target page by sliding the content in.

``` html
<a data-role='button' data-transition='slide' href='#page-2'>Slide</a>
```

Or we can configure the default page transition via JavaScript:

``` javascript
$.mobile.defaultPageTransition = 'slide';
```
